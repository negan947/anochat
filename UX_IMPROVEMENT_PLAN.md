# AnoChat UX Improvement Plan

## Current Problems Identified

### ðŸš¨ Major UX Issues

1. **Confusing Entry Flow**: Users don't understand what an "identity" is or why they need one
2. **Complex Room Management**: Creating/joining rooms requires technical knowledge
3. **No Onboarding**: Users are thrown into cryptographic concepts without guidance
4. **Poor Visual Hierarchy**: No clear progression or next steps
5. **Technical Jargon**: Terms like "fingerprint", "pre-key bundle", "passphrase" confuse users
6. **Multiple Disconnected Steps**: Identity â†’ Menu â†’ Room â†’ Chat flow is not intuitive

### ðŸŽ¯ Key User Goals (What users actually want to do)

1. **Start chatting quickly** with minimal setup
2. **Connect with a friend** easily
3. **Have private conversations** without technical complexity
4. **Share a room/invite** with simple copy-paste or QR
